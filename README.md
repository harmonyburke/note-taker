(Application will be deployed in heroku eventually. I am currently waiting on heroku support to get back to me as I am mysteriously locked out of my account.)

## Installation
To use this application, install express.js and run npm start in the integrated terminal. 
## Usage

To use this application, simply type in a title for your note, and then enter the note's text and click save. You can click on the note on the sidebar to view it again, and click 'new note' to add another note.

## Credits
I was given starter code for this project. I used my courework for help on this project. I also received help from my tutor, Josshy Olea.
